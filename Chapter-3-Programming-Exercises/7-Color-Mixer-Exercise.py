# Design a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary colors to mix.
# If the user enters anything other than "red", "blue", or "yellow", the program should
# display an error message. Otherwise, the program should display the name of the secondary
# color that results.

# Ask user for input
color1 = input("Please enter a color. Choose one from red, blue, or yellow.")
color2 = input("Please enter another color. Choose one from red, blue, or yellow.")
